# GroupMaker
GroupMaker.py is a Python3-based program that will create groups based on a CSV file. The product will import the CSV file, parse through it, and ultimately group students together based on the condition that the user chooses. <br/><br/>The user will be able to sort groups based on blacklists and other custom metrics. The user will also be able to set the number of groups once they start running the program. The program will display the groups to the user after they are created. It will also create an output CSV that will contain all the groups that have been run by the program.
